"""
Reproduces the reported bug (SubAdmin login fails with "Invalid email or
password" because the demo SubAdmin account was never seeded -- only
`seed_superadmin.py` was run, `seed_subadmin.py` was skipped, exactly like
the already-fixed demo Employee case) against the real, unmodified
auth_service.login_with_email_password / send_demo_otp / verify_demo_otp,
then verifies that seed_subadmin.seed_core() -- the same function
server.py's startup lifespan now calls automatically -- fixes it for both
the email/password flow and the mobile OTP flow, is idempotent across
repeated startups, self-heals a corrupted password hash, and does not
touch SuperAdmin or Employee accounts/logins.
