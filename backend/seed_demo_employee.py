"""
Seeds ONE demo Employee account, and keeps it usable.

Unlike SuperAdmin (a direct `users` insert), an employee login account can
only ever come into existence through the real application -> SuperAdmin
approval flow (see services/application_service.py). This script walks that
exact flow -- submitting a demo application and approving it with the seeded
SuperAdmin as reviewer -- instead of inserting a parallel/duplicate auth
record. This keeps a single source of truth for how employee accounts get
created.

- Idempotent: running this multiple times never creates duplicates.
- Self-healing: if the demo Employee's `users` record already exists but its
  password hash does not match the configured demo password (e.g. an
  earlier run used a different SEED_EMPLOYEE_PASSWORD, or the record was
  edited by hand), the hash is regenerated and updated in place -- the same
  targeted fix seed_superadmin.py applies, reusing the same hashing utility.
  No new login/authentication logic is introduced; only the stored hash on
  the existing record is corrected.
- Requires the demo SuperAdmin to already exist (run seed_superadmin.py
  first), since approval requires a reviewer.
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt via utils/security.py. The plain password
  is never written to the database.

Usage:
    python seed_demo_employee.py

    """The actual seeding logic, taking an already-connected db handle.
    Split out from seed() so server.py's startup lifespan can run this same,
    already-idempotent/self-healing logic automatically on every boot --
    without opening/closing a second Mongo connection on top of the app's
    own. This is the fix for demo Employee login failing with "Invalid email
    or password": that account only ever existed if someone manually ran
    `python seed_demo_employee.py` after `seed_superadmin.py`; if that step
    was skipped, no `users`/`employees`/`employee_applications` record for
    employee.demo@strivenest.com exists at all, so login correctly (per the
    existing auth code) falls through to the generic invalid-credentials
    message. No authentication logic changes -- the account now just always
    exists, created through the exact same real
    application -> SuperAdmin-approval flow as before.
